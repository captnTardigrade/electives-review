# Electives Review
This is your half-yearly destination where you can hopefully decide which elective to take. Thanks to [@dheerajrox](https://github.com/dheerajrox) for the heads-up on this idea!
The courses data can be found in the [seeds](https://github.com/captnTardigrade/electives-review/tree/main/seeds) folder.  
The descriptions may not be perfect as they were extracted from PDFs. Feel free to fix it and open a PR.
